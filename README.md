# Iris_Classification

Certainly! Iris classification is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on certain features. The famous Iris dataset consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers, belonging to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

This code does the following:

Imports necessary libraries.
Loads the Iris dataset.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Initializes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel.
Trains the classifier on the training data.
Makes predictions on the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy of the classifier.
